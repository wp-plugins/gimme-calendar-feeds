Allows creation of custom iCal feeds for upcoming events, based on event category. Requires Modern Tribe's - The Event Calendar.


== Description ==

This plugin is an extension of <a href="http://tri.be">Modern Tribe's - The Events Calendar</a>, as such it will not function without that plugin on your Wordpress installation.

This plugin and myself have no affiliation with Modern Tribe and do not represent the company or its products.

The plugin was designed to create dynamic iCal feeds from your Calendar's events.

Those feeds can then be used to plug into other copies of The Events Calendar, on other websites. Specifically, those installations that also have Modern Tribe's paid plugin "iCal importer".

Thus, the creation of distributed event calendaring.
